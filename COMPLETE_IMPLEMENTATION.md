## ‚úÖ Workflows Implemented

### Flow 1: Complaint/Service Error Workflow
**Trigger**: Service/system error keywords (e.g., "MBPP website is down")  
**Steps**: 6  
**Output**: Service complaint ticket

```
User: "MBPP website is down"
Bot: "Would you like to report an incident?"
User: "Not an incident (Service Complaint)"
Bot: "Please describe the issue"
User: "MBPP website down now, cannot access"
Bot: "Can you confirm if your internet connection is working?"
User: "Yes"
Bot: "Ticket logged: 20239/09/25"
```

### Flow 2: Text-Driven Incident Report
**Trigger**: Incident keywords without image (e.g., "I want to report a fallen tree")  
**Steps**: 7  
**Output**: Incident report ticket

```
User: "I want to report a fallen tree"
Bot: "Please share image, location and describe what happened"
User: "Fallen tree blocking main road at Jalan Terapung"
Bot: "Can you confirm you would like to report an incident?"
User: "Yes, report an incident"
Bot: "Where is this? Share location or type address"
User: [Shares GPS location]
Bot: "Could you confirm if it's blocking the road?"
User: "Yes"
Bot: "Ticket logged: 20368/09/25"
```

### Flow 3: Image-Driven Incident Report
**Trigger**: Image upload with incident keywords  
**Steps**: 6  
**Output**: Incident report ticket

```
User: [Uploads image of fallen tree]
Bot: "Image detected. Can you confirm you would like to report an incident?"
User: "Yes, report an incident"
Bot: "Please describe what happened and tell us the location"
User: "Fallen tree blocking main road at Jalan Batu Feringghi"
Bot: "Could you confirm if it's blocking the road?"
User: "Yes"
Bot: "Ticket logged: 20368/09/25"
```

### RAG Question Answering
**Trigger**: General questions  
**Steps**: 1  
**Output**: Knowledge-based answer

```
User: "What are MBPP's operating hours?"
Bot: "MBPP operates from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM, Monday to Friday..."
```
