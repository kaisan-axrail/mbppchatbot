aws dynamodb scan --table-name mbpp-reports --profile test --region ap-southeast-1 | jq '.Items[-3:]'
```

**âœ… PASS**: 3 new reports created

### Check S3 (for Test 3)
```bash
# List images
aws s3 ls s3://mbpp-incident-images-{ACCOUNT}/incidents/ --recursive --profile test

# Count images
aws s3 ls s3://mbpp-incident-images-{ACCOUNT}/incidents/ --recursive --profile test | wc -l
```

**âœ… PASS**: At least 1 image uploaded

## Quick Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| WebSocket won't connect | Check endpoint URL, verify deployment |
| No bot response | Check CloudWatch logs, verify Lambda is running |
| Workflow doesn't start | Use exact keywords: "complaint", "incident", "report" |
| No ticket generated | Check DynamoDB tables exist, verify permissions |
| Image not uploading | Check S3 bucket exists, verify image size <1MB |
