# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses authentication issues in the AWS Bedrock chatbot system, specifically focusing on resolving IAM permission problems, credential management, and ensuring proper access to Bedrock services. The enhancement will provide robust authentication mechanisms and clear error handling for authentication failures.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper IAM permissions configured for all Lambda functions, so that the chatbot can successfully invoke Bedrock models without authentication errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Lambda function attempts to invoke Bedrock THEN the system SHALL have the necessary IAM permissions configured
2. WHEN using inference profiles THEN the system SHALL have permissions for both foundation models and inference profiles
3. IF IAM permissions are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating which permissions are needed
4. WHEN deploying the system THEN all required Bedrock permissions SHALL be automatically configured

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive authentication error handling, so that I can quickly identify and resolve authentication issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including the specific permission that failed
2. WHEN credential issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide actionable error messages with resolution steps
3. WHEN role assumption fails THEN the system SHALL indicate which role and which service principal is involved
4. WHEN debugging authentication THEN the system SHALL provide tools to validate current permissions and access

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want automatic credential validation, so that authentication issues are detected before they impact users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL validate all required AWS credentials and permissions
2. WHEN deploying updates THEN the system SHALL verify that new IAM policies are correctly applied
3. IF credential validation fails THEN the system SHALL prevent startup and provide clear remediation steps
4. WHEN credentials expire or change THEN the system SHALL detect and handle the authentication state gracefully

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper AWS SDK configuration, so that all AWS service calls use the correct credentials and region settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making AWS API calls THEN the system SHALL use the correct AWS profile and region configuration
2. WHEN running in Lambda THEN the system SHALL properly inherit IAM role credentials
3. WHEN running locally THEN the system SHALL use appropriate local AWS credentials
4. WHEN switching between environments THEN the system SHALL automatically adapt credential sources

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want minimal privilege access controls, so that the system has only the necessary permissions to function.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring IAM policies THEN the system SHALL follow the principle of least privilege
2. WHEN accessing Bedrock models THEN permissions SHALL be scoped to only the required models and regions
3. WHEN accessing other AWS services THEN permissions SHALL be limited to the specific resources needed
4. WHEN reviewing security THEN all permissions SHALL be documented with justification for their necessity

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want authentication monitoring and alerting, so that I can proactively address authentication issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication failures occur THEN the system SHALL generate alerts with detailed context
2. WHEN permission changes are needed THEN the system SHALL provide recommendations for IAM policy updates
3. WHEN credential rotation occurs THEN the system SHALL monitor for any resulting authentication issues
4. WHEN access patterns change THEN the system SHALL detect and report unusual authentication behavior
