# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a websocket-based chatbot system that integrates with an existing webchat interface using entirely AWS services. The chatbot provides three main capabilities: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for document-based queries using AWS Bedrock embeddings and AWS OpenSearch, general question answering using AWS Bedrock Claude models, and integration with MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools for extended functionality. The system uses AWS Bedrock for AI model interactions, AWS Lambda for serverless execution, AWS API Gateway for WebSocket connections, and AWS DynamoDB for data storage. It includes session management with automatic cleanup for inactive sessions. The system includes both the chatbot server and an MCP server with RAG and CRUD tools, all deployed using AWS CDK.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to connect to the chatbot through websockets so that I can have real-time conversations with low latency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user connects to the websocket endpoint THEN the system SHALL establish a persistent connection
2. WHEN a user sends a message through the websocket THEN the system SHALL receive and process the message in real-time
3. WHEN the chatbot generates a response THEN the system SHALL send the response back through the websocket connection
4. WHEN a websocket connection is lost THEN the system SHALL handle reconnection gracefully

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to ask general questions to the chatbot so that I can get helpful responses on various topics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a general question THEN the chatbot SHALL process the query using a language model
2. WHEN the chatbot processes a general question THEN it SHALL return a relevant and helpful response
3. WHEN a user asks follow-up questions THEN the chatbot SHALL maintain conversation context
4. IF a question is unclear THEN the chatbot SHALL ask for clarification

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to query documents using RAG functionality so that I can get accurate answers based on my document collection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks a question about documents THEN the system SHALL retrieve relevant document chunks using AWS OpenSearch vector search with AWS Bedrock embeddings
2. WHEN relevant documents are found THEN the system SHALL use them as context to generate an accurate response using AWS Bedrock Claude models
3. WHEN no relevant documents are found THEN the system SHALL inform the user that no relevant information was found
4. WHEN processing RAG queries THEN the system SHALL cite sources in the response

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the chatbot to use MCP tools so that I can access extended functionality through natural language commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user request requires tool usage THEN the chatbot SHALL identify the appropriate MCP tool
2. WHEN an MCP tool is identified THEN the system SHALL execute the tool with proper parameters
3. WHEN a tool execution completes THEN the system SHALL incorporate the results into the response
4. IF a tool execution fails THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and inform the user

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want an MCP server with RAG and CRUD tools using OpenAPI schema so that the chatbot can access document retrieval and data management capabilities with proper validation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MCP server starts THEN it SHALL expose RAG tools for document search and retrieval using AWS Bedrock embeddings and AWS OpenSearch with OpenAPI schema definitions
2. WHEN the MCP server starts THEN it SHALL expose CRUD tools for AWS DynamoDB data management operations with OpenAPI schema definitions
3. WHEN a RAG tool is called THEN it SHALL validate input parameters against OpenAPI schema and perform vector search using AWS OpenSearch with AWS Bedrock embeddings
4. WHEN a CRUD tool is called THEN it SHALL validate input parameters against OpenAPI schema and perform the requested create, read, update, or delete operation on AWS DynamoDB
5. WHEN any MCP tool is called THEN it SHALL return structured results following OpenAPI schema that can be processed by the chatbot
6. WHEN MCP tools are registered THEN they SHALL include complete OpenAPI schema documentation for input and output validation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to handle different types of chatbot requests so that users can seamlessly switch between RAG, general questions, and tool usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a message THEN the system SHALL determine the appropriate processing mode (RAG, general, or tool usage)
2. WHEN the processing mode is determined THEN the system SHALL route the request to the correct handler
3. WHEN switching between modes THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation continuity
4. WHEN multiple capabilities are needed THEN the system SHALL coordinate between different processing modes

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to store conversation data and analytics in DynamoDB so that I can track usage patterns and system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks a question THEN the system SHALL store the question, response, and metadata in DynamoDB
2. WHEN an MCP tool is called THEN the system SHALL log the tool name, parameters, and results in DynamoDB
3. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL include session ID, timestamp, and user context
4. WHEN querying stored data THEN the system SHALL support efficient retrieval by session ID and timestamp

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to manage my conversation sessions so that my interactions are organized and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user connects THEN the system SHALL create or resume a session with a unique session ID
2. WHEN a session is active THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation context within that session
3. WHEN a user is inactive for a specified period THEN the system SHALL automatically close the session
4. WHEN a session is closed THEN the system SHALL clean up session data and notify the client if still connected

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the chatbot to use AWS Bedrock Claude models as the language model so that users receive high-quality responses using entirely AWS services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing general questions THEN the system SHALL use AWS Bedrock Claude models for response generation
2. WHEN processing RAG queries THEN the system SHALL use AWS Bedrock Claude models with retrieved context from AWS OpenSearch
3. WHEN using MCP tools THEN the system SHALL use AWS Bedrock Claude models to interpret results and generate responses
4. WHEN AWS Bedrock or the language model is unavailable THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase to follow clean code best practices so that the system is maintainable, readable, and follows industry standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing code THEN all variables SHALL use camelCase naming convention
2. WHEN defining constants THEN they SHALL use UPPERCASE_SNAKE_CASE naming convention
3. WHEN creating functions THEN they SHALL include type annotations following PEP 484
4. WHEN importing modules THEN imports SHALL be organized in standard library, third-party, and local application groups
5. WHEN handling exceptions THEN specific exceptions SHALL be caught before generic exceptions
6. WHEN implementing logging THEN structured logging SHALL be used with appropriate log levels
7. WHEN creating functions THEN they SHALL avoid redundancy and be grouped logically in utility modules
8. WHEN writing code THEN line length SHALL not exceed 79 characters for general code

### Requirement 11
