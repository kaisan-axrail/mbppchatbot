# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing AWS Bedrock model invocation system to provide better user experience through streaming responses, improved conversation history management, and more robust error handling. The enhancement will build upon the current multi-tier fallback system while adding streaming capabilities and optimizing the conversation flow for real-time interactions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a chatbot user, I want to see responses being generated in real-time, so that I can start reading the response while it's being generated and have a more interactive experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a message THEN the system SHALL start streaming the response immediately as tokens are generated
2. WHEN streaming is active THEN the system SHALL send partial responses to the client in real-time
3. IF streaming fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to non-streaming response generation
4. WHEN a streaming response is complete THEN the system SHALL send a completion indicator to the client

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a chatbot user, I want my conversation history to be efficiently managed, so that the system maintains context without performance degradation over long conversations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN conversation history exceeds 20 messages THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent truncation while preserving context
2. WHEN processing conversation history THEN the system SHALL optimize token usage by summarizing older messages
3. WHEN a conversation becomes too long THEN the system SHALL maintain the most recent exchanges and key context points
4. WHEN conversation context is processed THEN the system SHALL ensure multilingual conversations are handled appropriately

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want enhanced error handling and monitoring for Bedrock invocations, so that I can quickly identify and resolve issues with model access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Bedrock invocation fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error context including model ID, error type, and suggested actions
2. WHEN multiple fallback attempts fail THEN the system SHALL log comprehensive failure information for debugging
3. WHEN rate limiting occurs THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff with jitter
4. WHEN service degradation is detected THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust request parameters to maintain service

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want improved conversation state management, so that I can build more sophisticated conversational flows and maintain better context across interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing conversation state THEN the system SHALL support conversation branching and context switching
2. WHEN storing conversation history THEN the system SHALL implement efficient caching with TTL management
3. WHEN retrieving conversation context THEN the system SHALL support filtering by conversation type and user preferences
4. WHEN conversation data grows large THEN the system SHALL implement compression for storage efficiency

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a chatbot user, I want the system to handle different types of responses appropriately, so that I get the most suitable response format for my query type.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing a RAG query THEN the system SHALL optimize streaming for document-based responses with source citations
2. WHEN handling general queries THEN the system SHALL use appropriate temperature and token settings for conversational responses
3. WHEN processing MCP tool queries THEN the system SHALL stream tool execution status and results appropriately
4. WHEN query type is uncertain THEN the system SHALL use adaptive parameters based on response content analysis

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want comprehensive monitoring and analytics for model invocations, so that I can optimize performance and costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN model invocations occur THEN the system SHALL track token usage, response times, and success rates
2. WHEN streaming responses are generated THEN the system SHALL monitor streaming performance metrics
3. WHEN fallback mechanisms are triggered THEN the system SHALL log fallback reasons and success rates
4. WHEN cost optimization is needed THEN the system SHALL provide recommendations based on usage patterns

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want flexible model configuration options, so that I can optimize the system for different use cases and deployment environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring models THEN the system SHALL support dynamic model selection based on query characteristics
2. WHEN using inference profiles THEN the system SHALL support both regional and cross-regional configurations
3. WHEN model parameters need adjustment THEN the system SHALL allow runtime configuration updates
4. WHEN testing model access THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive validation and health check capabilities
